[{"text": "   Say \"R\".      R...      Now, \"O\".      O...      Dad, now...  \n   -Hmm      Say \"extraordinary\".      Every story has a purpose and a meaning.      Purpose...      Is to say sorry...      To all those I've hurt.      And as for meaning,      I don't know...      First incision from here.  \n   And then, here...      And if needed, then the  \n   entire neck.      What's my favourite restaurant?      Our pizza place.      You don't know me.      Does it hurt?      A little.      What are you doing here, Arjun?      I told you, I will see you on Monday.      For you Monday is Monday,  \n   For me Monday is right now.      It's called pumpkin.      Over here, it grows big in size.      But we grow small.      Hey, Reya.      Hi!      Is she with her boyfriend?      Next question will be...      Is Reya pregnant?      What happened?      Is she pregnant?      Dad, shh!!        Come, come with me.      You really enjoy doing this eh?!      Why don't you live next to the hospital!!      And get an automatic wheelchair.  \n   Zoom in and out on it.      I told you about attending  \n   therapy sessions.      Are you going?      Oh yes, and doctor...  \n   -Hmm      You don't worry, okay?      When I'm nearing death...      I won't rush to emergency.      I'll come here directly.      Then I will change my door locks.      How about that?      When you get your life back,  \n   what will you do, Arjun?  "}]
