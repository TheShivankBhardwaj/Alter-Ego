Alter-Ego Chatbot

Welcome to the Alter-Ego Chatbot, a fun and interactive AI-powered chat application that lets you converse with personas modeled after real people! Built using Streamlit and powered by Google’s Gemini AI, this app pulls transcripts from interviews, podcasts, and videos to mimic the speech patterns, tone, and personality of your chosen persona.

Features
- Persona Selection: Enter a name (e.g., "Hitesh Choudhary") and optional occupation (e.g., "Youtuber") to create a custom AI persona.
- Realistic Responses: The chatbot mimics the persona’s unique style, slang, and worldview based on recent video transcripts.
- Premium UI: Sleek chat interface with user messages on the right and persona replies on the left, plus smooth input clearing.
- Public Access: Hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud—anyone with the link can chat!

How It Works
1. The app fetches the latest video transcripts from YouTube using the YouTube Data API.
2. Google’s Gemini AI processes these transcripts to build a persona’s “voice.”
3. Streamlit provides a responsive web interface for real-time chatting.
